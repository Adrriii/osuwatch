# osu!watch
Discord bot giving notice of newly ranked maps

# Running

You can run this bot, but the database on which it depends is not open source. You can easily reverse engineer it though.

You need at least node 12.

To run, just clone and do npm install. In config/, copy the file "default.json.example" to "default.json" and fill the required fields accordingly.

Then, run the command `npm run start`
